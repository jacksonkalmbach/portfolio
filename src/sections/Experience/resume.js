      "In a multifaceted role, I developed a Chrome Extension available on the Chrome Web Store, harnessing the OpenAI API and GitHub REST API. This extension is underscored by a robust architecture built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Integration with GitHub OAuth and Firebase ensured user-friendly authentication. The backend, designed in Python Flask, effectively utilizes Google Cloud Storage and PostgreSQL for data management and performance optimization. Notably, by caching summaries, we achieved faster response times, and storing chat data allowed for more context-aware interactions via OpenAI.",

      "I spearheaded the development of a GraphQL middleware for enhanced query security, accompanied by a React-based data visualization frontend. Within its first two months, this middleware garnered 500 downloads on npm. Through GraphQL, we streamlined dashboard data rendering and minimized API calls. We incorporated Redis for caching cost analyses based on IP addresses, boosting performance and efficiency. Furthermore, using Jest and React Testing Library, we ensured feature reliability through effective data-mocking.",
